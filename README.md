### Hey Code Warriors,
these are some of my Codewars Kata Solutions. 
I train the following languages:
- C#
- Python

- JavaScript
  
This is the basic project stucture:

<pre>

|- Kyu
   |- Kata

Remember that copy-pasting solutions is considered unhonorable on Codewars and also blocks personal progress. <br>
Happy coding! :)
