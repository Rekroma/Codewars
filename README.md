### Hey Code Warriors,
these are some of my Codewars Kata Solutions. 
I train the following languages:
- C# (Nunit test project: namespaces have been added/adjusted)
- Python
- SQL
- JavaScript
  
This is the basic project stucture:

<pre>
Codewars
|- Kyu
   |- Kata
      |- Language File Extension (numbers have been converted to text and special characters are ignored)
</pre>

Remember that copy-pasting solutions is considered unhonorable on Codewars and also blocks personal progress. <br>
Happy coding! :)
