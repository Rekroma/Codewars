### Hey Code Warriors,
these are some of my Codewars Kata Solutions. 
I train the following languages:
- C#
- Python
- SQL
- JavaScript
  
Remember that copy-pasting solutions is considered unhonorable on Codewars and also blocks personal progress. <br>
This is the basic project stucture:
<pre>
Codewars
|- Kyu
   |- Kata
      |- KataID.Extension
</pre>
You can use https://www.codewars.com/kata/ + KataID, wich you can copy by pressing F2 and CTRL+C on the selected file, and optional /LANGUAGE to find the right Kata faster. <br>
Happy coding! :)
