### Hey Code Warriors,
these are some of my Codewars Kata Solutions. 
I train the following languages:
- C#
- Python
- SQL
- JavaScript
  
Remember that copy-pasting solutions is considered unhonorable on Codewars and also blocks personal progress.
The basic project stucture is: 
Codewars
|- Kyu 
   |-Kata
     |-KataID.language
You can use https://www.codewars.com/kata/<KATAID>, wich you can extract from the filename and optional /<LANGUAGE> to find the right Kata faster.
Happy coding!
:)
